Code style
Writing Terraform code in a consistent style makes it easier to read and maintain. The following sections discuss code style recommendations, including the following:

Run terraform fmt and terraform validate before committing your code to version control.
Use a linter such as TFLint to enforce your organization's own coding best practices.
Use # for single and multi-line comments.
Use nouns for resource names and do not include the resource type in the name.
Use underscores to separate multiple words in names. Wrap the resource type and name in double quotes in your resource definition.
Let your code build on itself: define dependent resources after the resources they reference.
Include a type and description for every variable.
Include a description for every output.
Avoid overuse of variables and local values.
Always include a default provider configuration.
Use count and for_each sparingly.
